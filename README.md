# decoder-ring
This is a capstone project for the Thinkful Software Engineering bootcamp.
It is our first capstone project. We are creating a "decoder ring" using three different methods of creating codes.
1. The Caeser Shift where each letter is shifted up or down the alphabet a set number of times to create the code
1. The Polybius Square where each letter is converted into a two digit code based on putting the letters on a grid
1. The Substitution Cypher where the entire alphabet is substituted with a different one, such that each letter has a pottentially different letter mapped to it

This is an individual project that we are doing. We are helping each others in small teams though. It is one of my first bigger projects I will have written.
I wrote the files in the src and test directory (with the exception of the *.submission.test.js files), the rest were provided for me.
